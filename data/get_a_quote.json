This is because last minute cancellations for multi-session full-day projects are nearly impossible to fill in time (Yes, I have had no shows for full 8 hour tattoos). For example: If you requested a full sleeve the estimated time to complete a full sleeve is 3 to 5 sessions (6-8 hours each), in this case, the deposit would cover the first 2-3 sessions and you would only pay the remaining time that was required to complete the piece. Large pieces like this can have an initial time investment of up to 40 hours for just the design which is why I require more upfront. <br/> You can only refund the deposit for multi session pieces if I have not started the design yet. This refund doesn't include the administration fee which is still non-refundable."
