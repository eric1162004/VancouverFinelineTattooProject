            "question": "What do I need to know about scar or stretch mark cover-up?",
            "answer": "Scar tissue is generally more painful to tattoo than unscarred skin. And in some cases, it might be extremely painful. Scarred skin is less able to absorb ink and tend to settle more irregularly than unscarred skin, therefore your tattoo might get smudged, discolored or unclear.</br></br>Before tattooing on scar, it’s recommended to wait at least a year until it’s completely healed.For deeper or larger scars, you might have to wait much longer for than that, like 3 or 5 years.</br></br>For people who have or are prone to keloid scars, there’s a higher chance that getting a tattoo to cover your scar will make the scar worse. </br></br>An experienced tattoo artist can help you find a design that works best for your scar. Or, you might want to consider a medical-grade tattoo that better matches your skin tone."

            "question": "What do I need to consider when choosing the tattoo area?",
            "answer": "Skin stretching. Our skin stretches in every movement, so it’s hard to keep the tattoo in same shape and condition or being straight all the time.</br></br>Tattoos on certain parts of the body can fade faster. Fingers, feet, knees and elbows can be difficult to heal and the skin regenerates faster on those spots, meaning that tattoo won't last as long. Also, they’re more likely to fade due to friction. And they might regularly require touch-up.</br></br>The Abdomen. Your belly grows or shrinks, so will your tattoo. If you’re planning on becoming pregnant or losing a lot of weight, you might want to hold off on your abdomen tattoo until after giving birth or losing weight.</br></br>Pain might be part of your consideration. Everyone has different levels of pain tolerance. In general, the least painful places to get tattooed are those with the most fat, fewest nerve endings, and thickest skin. For first tattoo, the most common area is on arm (further to armpit), not too close to bone and sensitive area."

            "question": "Does fine-line tattoo fade faster or require touch-up?",
            "answer": "Tattoo is permeant. However, all kinds of tattoos fade and age differently, depends on skin, application, and tattoo placement. Also, aftercare is very important to avoid fading and ink spreading. Most of my tattoo work doesn’t necessarily require touch-up. However, if part of the tattoo gets too light, I provide first touch-up for free within 1 year of initial session."

The tattooing process creates tens of thousands of tiny wounds, so it could causes temporary inflammation, redness, swollen, and tenderness. Your Saniderm bandage (second skin) may fill up with fluid, like an ink sac (watery bubble with mixture of blood, liquid and ink). But don’t worry. It is your tattoo weeping plasma, which plays a vital role in tattoo healing. </br></br>1st to 2nd week, top layer of skin peels, flakes or scabs. </br></br>1 month after tattooing, healing is much less visible but still ongoing in the skin. The skin continues to remodel underneath the tattoo for three to six months, after which tattoos are generally considered to be fully healed."
