            "question": "What do you need to know about scar or stretch mark cover-up?",
            "answer": "Scar tissue is generally more painful to tattoo than unscarred skin. And in some cases, it might be extremely painful. Scarred skin is less able to absorb ink and tend to settle more irregularly than unscarred skin, therefore your tattoo might get smudged, discolored or unclear.</br></br>Before tattooing on scar, it’s recommended to wait at least a year until it’s completely healed.For deeper or larger scars, you might have to wait much longer for than that, like 3 or 5 years.</br></br> For people who have or are prone to keloid scars, there’s a higher chance that getting a tattoo to cover your scar will make the scar worse. </br></br>An experienced tattoo artist can help you find a design that works best for your scar. Or, you might want to consider a medical-grade tattoo that better matches your skin tone."

            "question": "What do you need to consider when choosing the tattoo area?",
            "answer": "Skin stretching. Our skin stretches in every movement, so it’s hard to keep the tattoo in same shape and condition or being straight all the time.</br></br>Tattoos on certain parts of the body can fade faster. Fingers, feet, knees and elbows can be difficult to heal and the skin regenerates faster on those spots, meaning that tattoo won't last as long. Also, they’re more likely to fade due to friction. And they might regularly require touch-up.</br></br>The Abdomen. Your belly grows or shrinks, so will your tattoo. If you’re planning on becoming pregnant or losing a lot of weight, you might want to hold off on your abdomen tattoo until after giving birth or losing weight.</br></br>Pain might be part of your consideration. Everyone has different levels of pain tolerance. In general, the least painful places to get tattooed are those with the most fat, fewest nerve endings, and thickest skin. For first tattoo, the most common area is on arm (further away from armpit), not too close to bone and sensitive area."

            "question": "Does fine-line tattoo fade faster or require touch-up?",
            "answer": "Tattoo is permeant. However, all kinds of tattoos fade and age differently, depends on skin, application, and tattoo placement. Also, aftercare is very important to avoid fading and ink spreading. Most of my tattoo work doesn’t necessarily require touch-up. However, if part of the tattoo gets too light, I provide first touch-up for free within 1 year of initial session."

            "question": "How long does tattoo take to heal?",
            "answer": "3 steps of healing: </br></br>1st to 3rd day. The tattooing process creates tens of thousands of tiny wounds, so it could causes temporary inflammation, redness, swollen, and tenderness. Your Saniderm bandage (second skin) may fill up with fluid, like an ink sac (watery bubble with mixture of blood, liquid and ink). But don’t worry. It is your tattoo weeping plasma, which plays a vital role in tattoo healing. </br></br>1st to 2nd week, top layer of skin peels, flakes or scabs. </br></br>1 month after tattooing, healing is much less visible but still ongoing in the skin. The skin continues to remodel underneath the tattoo for three to six months, after which tattoos are generally considered to be fully healed."

            "question": "Can I get tattoo during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?",
            "answer": "Regarding the inks we use, they are vegan-friendly. However, the issue surrounding tattoo ink lies in the particle size of the pigment. This topic remains a subject of debate among medical professionals, with some asserting that it poses potential risks and others suggesting it may not be problematic.</br></br>Additionally, there's a significant concern about the risk of infections due to open wounds. It's worth noting that our studio adheres to strict hygiene protocols, using single-use sterilized equipment to minimize risks. Despite our meticulous precautions, infections can still occur, although we haven't encountered any such cases in our studio to date.</br></br>Considering these factors and the importance of minimizing potential risks, we do not recommend getting a tattoo while pregnant or breastfeeding.

            "question": "Can you use numbing before tattoo?",
            "answer": "Please DO NOT use pre-numb. These creams require at least a 30-minute application time, during which the skin absorbs the liquid, causing it to become saturated with water. Consequently, when we apply the ink, it becomes diluted, resulting in a tattoo that may heal with faded and less sharp lines.</br></br>However, if your session involves extensive work, we do offer an alternative: instant spray numbing. This option is particularly beneficial for subsequent shading, as it provides immediate relief without compromising the quality of your tattoo."
