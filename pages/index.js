            Fineline tattoo is subtle, delicate, and thin-line tattoo. Unlike
            traditional tattoos, which create thicker and bolder design,
            fine-line tattoos are created by just a single tattoo needle or
            combinations of small needles. This style of tattoo allows artist to
            create soft, tiny and minimalistic tattoos with intricately detailed
            design by using ultra-thin line incorporating with color, shading,
            and texture. Itâ€™s a growing trend in past decade to make delicate
            hidden tattoos, with super skinny lines and minimalist designs.

          <p className="paragraph">
            I am Miki, a tattoo artist in Ankh tattoo studio. I was born and
            raised in Hong Kong, and I moved to Vancouver since 2005. From an
            early age, I have always been passionate about art, drawing and
            designing. While working in the studio as brows artist, I got a
            chance to learning tattoo under mentorship of Nancy Liang. With the
            experience working in detail with machine, I was fascinated and
            extremely interested in the fine-line tattoo style, which create
            incredibly detailed minimalistic tattoo. Continuing advancing in
            past 3 years, I found my passion in micro-realistic style and love
            working on small dainty tattoo with incredible details and with
            color as highlight brightening up the piece. I also like to play
            with geometric design to create perfect line and shape on body.
