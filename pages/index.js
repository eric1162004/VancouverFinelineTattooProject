            Fineline tattoo is subtle, delicate, and thin-line tattoo. Unlike
            traditional tattoos, which create thicker and bolder design,
            fine-line tattoos are created by just a single tattoo needle or
            combinations of small needles. This style of tattoo allows artist to
            create soft, tiny and minimalistic tattoos with intricately detailed
            design by using ultra-thin line incorporating with color, shading,
            and texture. Itâ€™s a growing trend in past decade to make delicate
            hidden tattoos, with super skinny lines and minimalist designs.

              I am Miki, a tattoo artist in Ankh tattoo studio. I was born and
              raised in Hong Kong, and I moved to Vancouver since 2005. From an
              early age, I have always been passionate about art, drawing and
              designing. While working in the studio as brows artist, I got a
              chance to learning tattoo under mentorship of Nancy Liang. With
              the experience working in detail with machine, I was fascinated
              and extremely interested in the fine-line tattoo style, which
              create incredibly detailed minimalistic tattoo. Continuing
              advancing in past 3 years, I found my passion in micro-realistic
              style and love working on small dainty tattoo with incredible
              details and with color as highlight brightening up the piece. I
              also like to play with geometric design to create perfect line and
              shape on body.
